# Abstract

First talk about data collection

## Data Collection

Jacob can talk about collecting energy data here. Explain variable of interest here as well (cents per kilowatt hour) Also talking about temp collection.
To construct our data set, we collected data from several sources. For the data on monthly energy prices, we used the Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Monthly Electric Power Industry March 2024 report, specifically its reported price in cents per kilowatt hour in the “Total” category. We also used the EIA’s report on monthly energy generation by state, producer sector, and energy source, focusing just on data from the Total Electric Power Industry producer type, which is the sum of the power generation for all other types.  We extracted all energy categories from it. We also relied on data from FRED, including data on the number of Americans employed in the Oil Industry and US Production of Crude Oil. We included data from the National Centers for Environmental Information on average state monthly temperature (in Fahrenheit) and how that temperature deviated from the mean temperature of that state. For state-level monthly employment data, we utilized Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) measures published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This data includes civilian labor force, employed people, unemployed people, and unemployment rates. We also used this data to engineer a new variable capturing montly state-level labor force participation rates by month.

The variables included in our final dataset are:
* Year, Month: The year and month the observation was recorded the observation.
* State: The state of the observation was recorded in
* Thousand Dollars: Total Revenues collected in the state for electricity generation in thousand dollars.
* Megawatthours: Total sales of energy in Megawatt Hours.
* Count: Amount of customers serviced in the state.
* Oil_emp(thousands): Amount of individuals employed in the oil industry in the United states. Due to how the data was collected, this did not vary across states, only month and year.
* U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil: US production of crude oil, measured in thousand of barrels per day. Data for this variable was only available per year, so it was the same by state and month.
* Labor Force Participation Rate: Percentage of a state’s eligible working population that was participating in the labor force.
* Employment-Population Rate: The rate civilian labor force employed in the state against the total amount of working age population in the state by month.
* Gen data: This is data such as gas_gen and hydro_gen that measures the total generation of power by that type in the state measured in megawatthours.
* Temp and Temp_anomaly: Average temperature in a state for the given month and how much that average temperature deviates from the mean temperature for the state over the time period the data was taken.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

Before jumping into any complex modeling, it's crucial to visualize the data to understand the trends, patterns, and potential relationships. We began with a preliminary analysis to determine whether there is a relationship between unemployment rates and electricity prices. This relationship may indicate underlying economic reasons that both variables may be responding to. By looking at different time periods, we will determine whether the relationship between the variables changed over time, such as before, during, and after significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We also analyzed the relationship between monthly temperatures and energy costs, a crucial factor in assessing the impact of seasonal variations on energy costs. This analysis aims to uncover the extent to which temperature fluctuations drive changes in energy consumption and pricing. By exploring this correlation, we sought to determine how consumer energy expenditures respond to the seasonal patterns that may impact energy consumption.

We also looked at the relationship between energy generation and electricity price in cents/kWh. To do this, I calculated the total energy generation by state for a month and the average energy price in cents per kilowatt hour for each state for a month and found the correlation between the two to gen a general overview of the relationship between the 2. I also found the correlation between the individual energy generation types (petro, hydro, etc.) and energy price to look at the relationship between energy generation and energy prices. While this relationship is not causal, it may provide some insight on the effectiviness of this data in predicting energy prices.

## Model Construction

We began by constructing a baseline linear regression model that incorporates all available variables in our dataset—essentially everything but the kitchen sink. This approach allows us to understand the foundational relationships between energy costs and a wide array of factors, including economic indicators, energy production metrics, and climate variables. We can also use this model as the "baseline" to compare the performance of our other other models against it.

We then constructed a LASSO regression model to further refine our understanding by applying a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting and enhances the interpretability of the model. Using cross-validated Lasso regression, we determined the optimal lambda value that minimizes error, ensuring our model is both accurate and robust.

The other model we used to forecast energy prices was the tree model, specifically a randomforest model. The idea behind this model was to develop a model that would be better at predicting energy prices, despite having less interpretability. We opted to used randomforest due to its strong out of box performance and relatively few parameters that would be needed to adjusted to optimize its performance. It's method of selecting only a fraction of features in each of its trees also acted as a usefule form of cross validation. We tested 3 randomforest models. The first took the form `Cents/kWh` ~ Year + Month + State + Thousand_dollars +  Megawatthours + Count + oil_emp + US_Oil_Prod + Lab_part + Employ_rate + UR + coal_gen + hydro_gen + gas_gen + other_gen + petro_gen + solar_gen + biomass_gen + wind_gen + nuclear_gen + other_gas_gen + pump_gen + Temp + Temp_Anomaly, plugging in all variables we had identified in our data frame. The second random forest model took the first 5 principal components of entire data frame. Since tree models are prone to overfitting data with large amounts of features, we decided to test this model to avoid overfitting and using a lower dimensional summary of the data we relied. However, since this dataset was created by combining smaller data sets that were not closely related (such as unemployment and monthly temperature with energy production) there may be a concern that a PCA of elements of the data set may not effectively capture variation in the data. To address this concern while still using some lower dimensional summary of the data, we also estimated an third randomforest model that relied on the first 5 principal components of the energy generation data (coal_gen, hydro_gen, etc) along with the variables Year,  Month, State, thousand_dollars, Megawatthours, Count, oil_emp, US_Oil_Prod, Lab_part, Employ_rate, and UR. We used this model to provide a lower dimensional summary of the energy data with having to combine that summary with variables that might not related to energy generation (such as unemployment or labor force participation). 

All models were trained and tested on 80-20 split, with 80% of the data used to train the data and 20% used to test the data. We used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess the performance of the models.

We utilized data from June 2020 onward because the initial economic disruption caused by the onset of COVID-19 began to stabilize, potentially offering a more normalized view of the relationship between unemployment rates and energy costs in the emerging post-pandemic conditions.

After examining the graph plotting electricity prices against unemployment rates from 2018 to 2020, we see distinct patterns but cannot discern the nature of their relationship purely by observation. Therefore, to quantitatively assess the relationship between these two variables, we will conduct a correlation test. This statistical test will help us determine whether there's a statistically significant correlation between the electricity prices and the unemployment rates during this period, and if so, how strong that correlation is.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data_2018_2019 <- data %>%
  filter(Year >= 2018 & Year <= 2019) %>%
  select(Cents.kWh, UnemploymentRate)

data_2021_2023 <- data %>%
  filter(Year >= 2021 & Year <= 2023) %>%
  select(Cents.kWh, UnemploymentRate)

cor_test_2018_2019 <- cor.test(data_2018_2019$Cents.kWh, data_2018_2019$UnemploymentRate, use = "complete.obs")
cor_test_2021_2023 <- cor.test(data_2021_2023$Cents.kWh, data_2021_2023$UnemploymentRate, use = "complete.obs")

print(cor_test_2018_2019)
print(cor_test_2021_2023)
```
The correlation coefficient of -0.085 between 2018 and 2019 is slightly negative relationship. However, the relationship is weak. The correlation coefficient of 0.055 between 2021 and 2023  is slightly positive. However, it is also a weak relationship. Both periods show statistical significance with p-values less than 0.05, but given the weak correlation coefficients, the practical significance of these relationships is limited.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
time_correlations <- data %>%
  group_by(Year, Month) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(`Unemployment Rate`, `Cents/kWh`, use = "complete.obs")) %>%

```
This visualization explores the total correlation between unemployment rate and energy costs over time. We see a sharp increase in the correlation between these measures at the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic in March 2020. There are several potentially overlapping explanations for this insight. First, the pandemic caused a severe economic disruption in the labor market and energy sector, thus the sharp increase in correlation could indicate that these two variables were simulatenously affected by this economic shock. The increase in unemployment caused by the pandemic also led to many people working from home or otherwise altering their daily routine, thus shifting their energy consumption demand patterns. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- data %>%

```

This visualization shows the correlation between temperature and energy costs over time, a relationship that is key to understanding how weather influences consumer energy expenditures. We observe a distinct cyclical pattern in the correlation between these variables, indicating that their relationship is influenced by seasonal factors—likely varying energy demands for heating and cooling throughout the year.

### Energy Generation and Energy Prices Results

Plotting aver energy price in cents per kilowatt hour against total energy generation for a given month in a state produces the following the graph:
```{r, include = FALSE}
# Establishing relationship between energy generation and energy prices.
energy_gen_data = read_csv("C://Users/jacob/OneDrive/Documents/ECO-395M-Final-Project/Modified_data/final_data.csv") %>% 
  select(-1) 
energy_gen_monthly = energy_gen_data %>%
  group_by(Year, Month, State) %>%
  summarize(energy_total = sum(coal_gen + hydro_gen + gas_gen + other_gen + petro_gen + 
                              solar_gen +
                              biomass_gen + wind_gen + nuclear_gen + other_gas_gen),
            `Cents/kWh` = mean(`Cents/kWh`))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(energy_gen_monthly) +
  (geom_point(aes(x=energy_total, y = `Cents/kWh`)))

```
The relationship appears to be negative, but there is variation and significant clustering of data. Next, looking into the correlation of between energy production and energy prices produces these results. The first column is the estimated correlation between energy prices in cents per kilowatt hours while the second is the estimate p-value of that correlation.

                             other_gas_estimate, other_gas_p_value),
                            nrow = 11,
                            ncol = 2,
                            byrow = TRUE)
colnames(Energy_correlation) = c("Estimated Correlation", "P-Value")
rownames(Energy_correlation) = c("Total Energy Production", "Coal",
                                "Hydro", "Gas","Other", "Petro", "Solar", 
                                "Biomass", "Wind" , "Nuclear", "Other Gas")
Energy_correlation
```
As the scatter plot suggested, the top line correlation between total energy production and energy prices is negative. It is also statistically significant, although the actual value of the correlation is small, about 0.16. With the exception of petro, all energy generation types have a statistically significant correlation with energy prices, albeit of varying size and direction. About half are negative and half are positive. The largest is coal, which has a correlation of -0.41 with energy prices. These result would appear to be counterintuitive; it should be expected that energy generation's correlation with prices should not vary with type. However, since these correlations are not capturing a causal relationship, energy production may still be useful in estimating energy prices.

For our baseline randomforest model, we generated it from 1000 trees with 5 features in each. We selected 5 features for this model as the square root of the number of features was recommended as a rule of thumb and the baseline random forest model had 25 features. The RMSE for this model is: 

```{r, include = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# Now we will move onto random forest
rf_baseline = baseline %>%
  select(-1,-5, -10) %>%
  rename(Thousand_dollars = `Thousand Dollars`,
         oil_emp = `oil_emp(thousands)`,

         Lab_part = `Labor Force Participation`,
         Employ_rate = `Employment-Population Rate`,
         UR = `Unemployment Rate`)
energy_split =  initial_split(rf_baseline, prop=0.8)
energy_train = training(energy_split)
energy_test  = testing(energy_split)
energy.forest = randomForest(`Cents/kWh` ~ Year + Month + State + Thousand_dollars + 
                               Megawatthours + Count + oil_emp

Next we will find the RMSE for the PCA random forest model. Since this model has 8 features (the first 5 principal components and State, Month, and Year), we randomly generated 1000 trees with 3 features in each tree.

                                 + State + Month + Year, data= PCA_energy_train, ntree = 1000, mtry = 3, importance = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
modelr::rmse(PCA_energy.forest, PCA_energy_test)
```
Finally we have the tree model with the energy generation being summarized by the first 5 principal components. This model had 16 features, so each tree generated had 4 features included. The RMSE of this model is:
```{r, include = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# Do PCA applied to only power generation
PCA_gen = state_pca_gen %>%
  select(-4, -9) %>%
  rename(Thousand_dollars = `Thousand Dollars`,
         oil_emp = `oil_emp(thousands)`,
         US_Oil_Prod = `U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil Thousand Barrels per Day`,
         Lab_part = `Labor Force Participation`,
         Employ_rate = `Employment-Population Rate`,
         UR = `Unemployment Rate`)
  
PCA_gen_split = initial_split(PCA_gen, prop = 0.8)
PCA_gen_train = training(PCA_gen_split)
PCA_gen_test = testing(PCA_gen_split)
PCA_gen.forest = randomForest(`Cents/kWh` ~ PC1 + PC2 + PC3 + PC4 + PC5 
                              + Year + Month + State + Thousand_dollars + 
                                Megawatthours + Count + oil_emp 
                              + US_Oil_Prod + Lab_part + Employ_rate + UR, data= PCA_gen_train, ntree = 1000, mtry = 4, importance = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
modelr::rmse(PCA_gen.forest, PCA_gen_test)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
