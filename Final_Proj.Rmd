# Abstract

# Introduction

# Methods

First talk about data collection
Jacob can talk about collecting energy data here. Explain variable of interest here as well (cents per kilowatt hour) Also talking about temp collection

Daniel will talk about collecting unemployment here.


Then we list all variables and their units that will be included in the model.

Talk about initial data analysis
Musab and Daniel will process for analyzing data for unemployment and energy prices.

Daniel will talk about analyzing temperature and Energy

Jacob will talk about analzying energy generation and energy prices

Then discuss the models we will use
baseline (Daniel)

Lasso(Daniel and Musab)

randomforest(Jacob)

# Results

Results of visualization here

Start with Daniel and Musab discussing the results of their analysis of unemployment and gas prices

Daniel shows results of temperature

Jacob shows results of energy generation

Daniel discuss results of base

Daniel and Musab discuss results of Lasso

Jacob discusses results of random forest


# Conclusion

Determine which one is the best.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
