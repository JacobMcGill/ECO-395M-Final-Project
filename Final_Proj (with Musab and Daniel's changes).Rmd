# Abstract

# Introduction

# Methods

First talk about data collection
Jacob can talk about collecting energy data here. Explain variable of interest here as well (cents per kilowatt hour) Also talking about temp collection

For state-level monthly employment data, we utilized Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) measures published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This data includes civilian labor force, employed people, unemployed people, and unemployment rates. We also used this data to engineer a new variable capturing montly state-level labor force participation rates by month. 

Then we list all variables and their units that will be included in the model.

Before jumping into any complex modeling, it's crucial to visualize the data to understand the trends, patterns, and potential relationships. We began with a preliminary analysis to determine whether there is a relationship between unemployment rates and electricity prices. This relationship may indicate underlying economic reasons that both variables may be responding to. By looking at different time periods, we will determine whether the relationship between the variables changed over time, such as before, during, and after significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We also analyzed the relationship between monthly temperatures and energy costs, a crucial factor in assessing the impact of seasonal variations on energy costs. This analysis aims to uncover the extent to which temperature fluctuations drive changes in energy consumption and pricing. By exploring this correlation, we sought to determine how consumer energy expenditures respond to the seasonal patterns that may impact energy consumption. 

Jacob will talk about analzying energy generation and energy prices

Then discuss the models we will use
We began by constructing a baseline linear regression model that incorporates all available variables in our dataset—essentially everything but the kitchen sink. This approach allows us to understand the foundational relationships between energy costs and a wide array of factors, including economic indicators, energy production metrics, and climate variables.

We then constructed a LASSO regression model to further refine our understanding by applying a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting and enhances the interpretability of the model. Using cross-validated Lasso regression, we determined the optimal lambda value that minimizes error, ensuring our model is both accurate and robust.

We utilized data from June 2020 onward because the initial economic disruption caused by the onset of COVID-19 began to stabilize, potentially offering a more normalized view of the relationship between unemployment rates and energy costs in the emerging post-pandemic conditions. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
average_values$Date <- as.Date(paste(average_values$Year, average_values$Month, "01", sep = "-"))


filtered_data <- average_values %>%
  filter(Date >= as.Date("2018-01-01") & Date <= as.Date("2019-12-31"))

max_cents <- max(filtered_data$AverageCentsPerKWh, na.rm = TRUE)
max_unemployment_rate <- max(filtered_data$AverageUnemploymentRate, na.rm = TRUE)


ggplot(filtered_data) +
  geom_col(aes(x = Date, y = AverageUnemploymentRate), fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) +

    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * max_cents / max_unemployment_rate, name="Average Cents per kWh")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Monthly Average Cents per kWh and Unemployment Rate (January 2018 - May 2020)",

    y = "Average Unemployment Rate (%)",
    caption = "Note: Blue line represents Average Cents per kWh; Red columns represent Unemployment Rate."

```
After examining the graph plotting electricity prices against unemployment rates from 2018 to 2020, we see distinct patterns but cannot discern the nature of their relationship purely by observation. Therefore, to quantitatively assess the relationship between these two variables, we will conduct a correlation test. This statistical test will help us determine whether there's a statistically significant correlation between the electricity prices and the unemployment rates during this period, and if so, how strong that correlation is.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data_2018_2019 <- data %>%
  filter(Year >= 2018 & Year <= 2019) %>%
  select(Cents.kWh, UnemploymentRate)

data_2021_2023 <- data %>%
  filter(Year >= 2021 & Year <= 2023) %>%
  select(Cents.kWh, UnemploymentRate)

cor_test_2018_2019 <- cor.test(data_2018_2019$Cents.kWh, data_2018_2019$UnemploymentRate, use = "complete.obs")
cor_test_2021_2023 <- cor.test(data_2021_2023$Cents.kWh, data_2021_2023$UnemploymentRate, use = "complete.obs")

print(cor_test_2018_2019)
print(cor_test_2021_2023)
```
The correlation coefficient of -0.085 between 2018 and 2019 is slightly negative relationship. However, the relationship is weak. The correlation coefficient of 0.055 between 2021 and 2023  is slightly positive. However, it is also a weak relationship. Both periods show statistical significance with p-values less than 0.05, but given the weak correlation coefficients, the practical significance of these relationships is limited.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
time_correlations <- data %>%
  group_by(Year, Month) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(`Unemployment Rate`, `Cents/kWh`, use = "complete.obs")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(Year, Month) %>%
  mutate(Time = as.Date(paste(Year, Month, "01", sep="-")))

ggplot(time_correlations, aes(x = Time, y = correlation)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Unemployment & Electricity Costs: Correlation Over Time",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Correlation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2020-03-01"), linetype = "dashed", color = "darkred", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = as.Date("2020-03-01"), y = 0.8, label = "Start of COVID-19 Pandemic", color = "darkred", size = 4, angle = 0, vjust = 1, fontface = "bold", hjust = -0.03)

```
This visualization explores the total correlation between unemployment rate and energy costs over time. We see a sharp increase in the correlation between these measures at the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic in March 2020. There are several potentially overlapping explanations for this insight. First, the pandemic caused a severe economic disruption in the labor market and energy sector, thus the sharp increase in correlation could indicate that these two variables were simulatenously affected by this economic shock. The increase in unemployment caused by the pandemic also led to many people working from home or otherwise altering their daily routine, thus shifting their energy consumption demand patterns. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(Temp = as.numeric(Temp))

time_correlations_temp_energy <- data %>%
  group_by(Year, Month) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(Temp, `Cents/kWh`, use = "complete.obs")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(Year, Month) %>%
  mutate(Time = as.Date(paste(Year, Month, "01", sep="-")))

ggplot(time_correlations_temp_energy, aes(x = Time, y = correlation)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Between Temperature and Energy Costs Over Time",
       subtitle = "Data includes monthly average temperatures and energy costs",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Correlation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12))

```

This visualization shows the correlation between temperature and energy costs over time, a relationship that is key to understanding how weather influences consumer energy expenditures. We observe a distinct cyclical pattern in the correlation between these variables, indicating that their relationship is influenced by seasonal factors—likely varying energy demands for heating and cooling throughout the year.

baseline_model <- lm(`Cents/kWh` ~ Year + Month + State + `Thousand Dollars` + Megawatthours + 
                       Count + `oil_emp(thousands)` + `U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil Thousand Barrels per Day` + 
                       `Labor Force Participation` + `Employment-Population Rate` +

```

## LASSO Regression 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
X <- model.matrix(`Cents/kWh` ~ ., data = train_set)
Y <- train_set$`Cents/kWh`

# Perform cross-validated Lasso regression
cv <- cv.glmnet(X, Y, alpha = 1)

plot(cv)

# Select the alpha value with the lowest mean cross-validated error
best_alpha <- cv$lambda.min
best_alpha
lasso_model <- glmnet(X, Y, alpha = 1, lambda = best_alpha)

final_lasso <- glmnet(X, Y, alpha = 1, lambda = best_alpha, standardize = TRUE)
```

## Model Comparison
```{r, echo=FALSE}
baseline_predictions <- predict(baseline_model, newdata = test_set)
lasso_predictions <- predict(final_lasso, newx = model.matrix(`Cents/kWh` ~ ., data = test_set))

baseline_rmse <- sqrt(mean((baseline_predictions - test_set$`Cents/kWh`)^2))
lasso_rmse <- sqrt(mean((lasso_predictions - test_set$`Cents/kWh`)^2))
